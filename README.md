This project is a trivia game that writes content to the webpage.

There are ten questions. Each question displays on its own page with four answers. There is also a 30 second timer on the page. When the user answers a question or runs out of time, the content of the page changes to reflect the outcome of the question, and also plays an animated gif. When all questions are answered, the page shows the restults, and the user has the option to start the quiz again.

The theme of this project is Dark Souls, a video game released in 2011.
